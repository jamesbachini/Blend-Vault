0x05-02> Create a build and deployment script to deploy this to Stellar mainnet

0x05-03> I've deployed the contract to Stellar mainnet at this Contract ID:

Create a frontend for this contract which provides a simple, elegant user interface enabling the user to approve spend of USDC, deposit it into the vault, check both USDC in wallet balance and their balance of USDC in the pool (this might be tricky because I don't want to show their shares I want to know how much USDC they deposited + the interest earnt), withdraw funds back to their wallet.

The user interface should provide a modern, clean, mobile-responsive, dark by default, intuitive UI. It should be comparable with other leading DeFi applications.

Do not fake anything or create mocks or placeholders, this needs to be suitable for production.
